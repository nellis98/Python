# This program determines the miles per gallon of a vehicle based on the size of its gas tank and the distance it is able to travel.
tank_size = 15 #This is the variable for the number of gallons in a tank.
distance = 600 #This is the variable for the number of miles that the vehicle is able to drive.
mpg = distance / tank_size #This will solve for the miles per gallon by dividing the distance in miles by the tank size in gallons.
print("Miles per gallon:", mpg) #This will print the number of miles per gallon based on the values assigned to tank size and distance.
